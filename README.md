I'm a tech saavy generalist, with educational background in _Computer Sceince[^RUC]_, _Communication theories[^RUC]_ and _Business Coaching[^CCC]_. I'm facinated by the elegance and simplicity of Lean principles; Kaizen, respect for others, holistic view, long perspectives, solving wicked problems and building up a smooth flow by elimination all kinds of waste. And I'm equally facinated by Cognitive Science approach to didactics; how learning processes can be optimized, not only in general but even individually. I'm a consultant, mentor and advisor at heart.

In my worklife I've made it my speciality to facilitate and optimize software development processes together with software developers. Creating flows through continiously improving and eleminating waste from processes. For me personally it has _always_ been with a strong dedicated focus on optimizing the underlying infrastructure; the _operations_. Back in the days we called it _Application Management_ or _Iterative and incremental..._, then came _Agile_, _Build automation_, _Continuous Integration_, then _Continuos Delivery_, _DevOps_, _Containerization_, _Serverless_ and newest buzz to the hive; _DX: Developer Experience_.

The foundation underneath all these vibrant fizzy buzzes is to me the lean principles.
