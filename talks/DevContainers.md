# DevContainers, CodeSpaces ...and all that jazz

<img width="350" align="left" alt="Software eating the world" src="https://github.com/lakruzz/lakruzz/assets/155492/6c8a58cc-b610-4f92-91e6-418fa9674308"> **Software is eating the world.** Both Agile and DevOps are already gulped by software. If I were to form an agile team and utilize all the whistles and bells from the paradigms of _Continious Delivery_ and _DevOps_ today I would simply attend to another of the worlds contempray buzzes: _Developer Experience — DX_ Focus on understanding the developers workflow, and then weed out waste. Turns out that others have had that focus for years and we can simply tap into their results and outcomes.

This informal hands-on presentation is an exploration of some of the newest and coolest features in GitHub – the world's largest Developer Platform; _CodeSpaces_, _DevContainers_, _VS Code Extensions_, the `gh` CLI, _Actions_... It's a short practical demonstration on how this cornucopia of a full-fledged DX platform is introduced to new Gen Z coders at Copenhagen School of Design and Technology (KEA).
